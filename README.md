# defCalc
A beam loading analysis tool built on Matlab. 

After running defcalc.m, follow the prompts to get the information you need. Watch tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYvrAMpA4Mc 

UPDATE (9/20/17): Excuse the bad coding practices within the source code as this was my first Computer Science project
while I was still a Mechanical Engineering student. I promise my programming style has come a long way since then.
